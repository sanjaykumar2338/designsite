                    <blockquote>
                        "Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people who want
                        crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning; they
                        want the ocean without the roar of its many waters. The struggle may be a moral one, or
                        it may be a physical one, or it may be both. But it must be a struggle. Power concedes
                        nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.‚Äù -- Audre Lorde
