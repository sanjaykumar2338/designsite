            <h2>Political Conflicts that Demand Public Advocacy</h2><br>
            <h3>Fashion Activism and Global Conflicts: Advocate with Clothing</h3>
            <p>Recent events have sparked new tensions, terror, and extreme hostility driven by ideological and political
            motives, rooted in religious, ethnic, and territorial conflicts. These conflicts involve aggression, occupation,
            and oppression, often adopting deception tactics, bigotry, and propaganda to commit atrocities, genocide,
            and ethnic cleansing</p>
            <p>At Cause Stand, we stand in solidarity with the oppressed. We believe in the power of fashion to raise
            awareness and advocate for justice; our advocacy clothing is designed to spark conversations and bring
            attention to global conflicts, giving people a platform to express their voices and make a difference</p>

                            <p>The assault by Hamas against Israel on October 7, 2023, resulted in the death of around 1,300 people. Israel then announced war, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of  Palestinian civilians, claiming the right to defend itself. We empathize with all victims and aim to highlight the human cost of these conflicts.</p>

                            <p>Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine to prevent it from joining the European Union. Supporting the pro-Russian movement, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, terrorizing civilians and causing thousands of deaths and injuries. Our clothing serves as a reminder of the resilience and bravery of those affected.</p>
